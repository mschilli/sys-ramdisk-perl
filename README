NAME
    Sys::Ramdisk - Create and nuke RAM disks on various systems

SYNOPSIS
        use Sys::Ramdisk;

        my $ramdisk = Sys::Ramdisk->new(
           size => "100m",
           dir  => "/tmp/ramdisk",
        );

        $ramdisk->mount();

        # Use ramdisk on /tmp/ramdisk ...

        $ramdisk->unmount();

DESCRIPTION
    Most Unix systems provide RAM disks, although every OS/filesystem flavor
    seems to have its own interface to it. Sys::Ramdisk provides a
    system-agnostic interface to it, by abstracting the nitty gritty of the
    particular implementation.

METHODS
    "new()"
        Constructor, optional arguments are

        "size"
            The size of the RAM disk, defaults to 100m.

        "dir"
            The directory the RAM disk is going to be mounted under,
            defaults to a temporary directory, created on demand and
            returned by the dir() method later

        "cleanup"
            Set this to true if you want the object destructor unmount the
            yroot when the object goes out of scope. Defaults to true.

    "mount()"
        Mount the RAM disk.

    "unmount()"
        Unmount the RAM disk.

    "dir()"
        Set or get the name of the directory the RAM disk will be mounted
        under. Note that some operating systems mount the RAM disk under a
        different directory nevertheless (e.g. OSX), make sure to check
        $ramdisk->dir() after running mount() to figure out where it
        actually landed.

SUPPORTED OPERATING SYSTEMS
    Currently Linux, OSX, FreeBSD and OpenBSD are supported.
